            ASI was founded in 1947 as a department of the General Conference.
            <br />
            <br />
            At that time, there was a need for greater coordination and
            collaboration in mission work as lay people who had been trained at
            Madison College started businesses and ministries, founded churches,
            schools, sanitariums and hospitals, and advanced the mission of the
            Seventh-day Adventist Church across the Southern United States and
            around the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1985 when the North American Division was formed, ASI became one
            of its departments. The General Conference has encouraged each
            Division to develop an ASI Department.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ellen White often appealed for self-supporting missionaries to enter
            the unworked areas at their own expense and bring the Three Angels’
            Messages to those in need.
            <br />
            <br />
            Originally made up of only supporting ministry leaders, ASI now
            incorporates business owners and professionals alongside supporting
            ministry leaders and is focusing efforts on the next generation of
            business and ministry leaders through the ASI Young Professionals
            program.
